# HealthTAG content specification acceptance checklist

Use this checklist with `content-spec-implementation-plan.md`.

## Owner decisions

- [x] `/platform` is a landing page and does not replace the canonical deep pages.
- [x] Public identity-linkage naming is `Identity Connect` in English and `ระบบเชื่อมตัวตนผู้ป่วย` in Thai.
- [x] Public copy uses generic cloud-database wording and does not expose the specific vendor.
- [x] Siriraj stays within the confirmed Siriraj 5G Smart Hospital boundary.
- [x] Khian Sa is described as using HealthTAG FHIR Transformer since 1 June 2025.
- [x] The investor page and business-model categories are owner-confirmed.
- [x] Contact commits to a reply by email within seven days.
- [x] The confirmed public team role is `General Administration` / `ฝ่ายบริหารงานทั่วไป`.
- [x] Public-use permission for the confirmed organization, founder, and team information is recorded.

## Public naming and repository hygiene

- [x] Replace the retired identity-system name in public pages, articles, durable docs, and historical plan files.
- [x] Remove the specific cloud database vendor from public pages, articles, durable docs, and historical plan files.
- [x] Replace the previous assistant title with the confirmed public title.
- [x] Confirm the retired terms are absent from tracked and untracked source files:

```powershell
rg -n -i "Prompt[C]are|Dynamo[D]B" . --glob '!node_modules/**' --glob '!dist/**' --glob '!.git/**'
```

- [x] Rebuild, then confirm the same terms are absent from generated output:

```powershell
rg -n -i "Prompt[C]are|Dynamo[D]B" .astro dist
```

- [ ] Decide separately whether old Git history, releases, mirrors, and search caches need remediation. Do not rewrite history without explicit approval and coordination.

## Content ownership and data model
